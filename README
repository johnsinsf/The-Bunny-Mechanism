This is the top level directory.

To build the system:

cd src

"vi make.inc" to make any need changes for your system 

sh makeall

be sure to update ld.so.conf and run ldconfig!


Requirements:

-lcrypto -lssl -lcrypt -lmysqlclient_r -lxml2 -lxml++-3.0 -lglibmm-2.4 -lpthread  -lLabJackM -llog4cpp  -llabjackusb

other XML library versions should work too, or you can remove the dependencies by changing the file "make.inc".


Build the database if you require one:

mysql -u youruser -p -D yourDB < scripts/sql.sh


Create the Channel Types for the DIO system if needed:

This is used to auto load the channels for a new interface and translating fio/name for the U3.

mysql -u youruser -p -D yourDB
load data local infile "scripts/channel_types" into table channel_types;


Update the config file:
cd conf
cd conf
vi dss.conf and edit database entries and interface entries

If you want to use the Host System, signon to dwanta.com and get the siteID, companyID, dpsID, and password_encrypted and update dss.conf.

After downloading the site certificate, you'll need to store in PEM format:

Get the passphrase from the devices screen where the file was downloaded, you'll need to type that in and then you can
select a new passsphrase for the PEM or you can use the same one. Whichever passphrase you use goes into dss.conf with 
the file name.

openssl pkcs12 -in sitecert.pkcs12 -out dss.pem // get the passphrase from the devices screen where the file was downloaded.

In dss.conf, put dss.pem as the certificate file name and add the passphrase as certpass too.


Run the system:

cd bin
./bunnymech &

The logs should be in /var/logs/user.log or whatever is configured in the log4cpp.properties file in bin.

If everything is set up correctly the interfaces will auto load the channels into the database on the initial run and it will monitor all channels.
